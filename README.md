# GP
This project is used for analysis the effect of β-GP and urea for Streptococcus thermophilus by REMI.

Codes using for analyzing data in paper 'Investigating the role of β-disodium glycerophosphate and urea in promoting growth of Streptococcus thermophilus from omics-integrated genome-scale models'.

1  data: The folder contains data which are required to execute REMI walkthrough script. It comprises transciptomics and metabolomics.

2  models: The folder contains condition-specific models.

3  scripts: We provides scripts which one we used to generate models, compute alternative solutions, find common reactions.

4  simData: All results are saved in the folder.
