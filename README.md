# GP
This project is used for analysis the effect of β-GP and urea for Streptococcus thermophilus by REMI
Codes using for analyzing data in paper 'Investigating the role of β-disodium glycerophosphate and urea in promoting growth of Streptococcus thermophilus from omics-integrated genome-scale models'.
data: The folder contains data which are required to execute REMI walkthrough script. It comprises transciptomics and metabolomics.
models: The folder contains condition-specific models.
scripts: We provides scripts which one we used to generate models, compute alternative solutions, find common reactions.
simData: All results are saved in the folder.
